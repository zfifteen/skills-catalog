# FA Credit Decisioning - Sub-flow Reference

**Tools used:** `fa_search_tool`, `query_portfolio`, `get_company_report`

This file defines the Credit Decisioning workflow. It is loaded by the master
`SKILL.md` when user intent resolves to a credit decisioning request or a
company overview to support a credit decision.

**Core question answered by this workflow:**

> "Give me a full picture of [Company X] so I can make an informed credit decision."

Use this workflow for broad, report-driven credit decisioning. Do not use it for
focused point questions (those call only the relevant tool directly) or for credit limit
validation requests (use `fa-credit-validation.md` instead).

## Pipeline Overview

```
Stage 1:  Resolve Company
  -> Stage 2:  Retrieve Report Data
    -> Stage 3:  Produce Credit Decisioning Report
```

---

## Trigger Examples

- "Provide an overview of Company Z to help me make a credit decision."
- "Provide an overview of Company Z, focusing on recent financials, negative legal events,
  and credit profile."
- "Run a credit decisioning for Company Z."
- "Generate the credit decisioning report for company X."
- Any question asking for a general company assessment that is NOT a portfolio question,
  NOT a focused credit limit validation, and NOT a narrow single-metric query.

---

## Stage 1 - Resolve Company

**Purpose:** Identify the correct company and obtain its DUNS number.

**Tool call sequence:**

1. If the user provided a DUNS directly: use it. Skip `fa_search_tool`.
2. If the user provided only a company name: call `fa_search_tool` with name and country.
   - If exactly one high-confidence match: proceed with that DUNS.
   - If multiple matches: show a short table (name, country, DUNS) and ask the user to
     select the correct company or provide the DUNS directly.
   - If no match: report that no record was found and ask the user to verify the name.

**Required outputs:** Confirmed company name, DUNS, country.

**Failure condition:** Do not proceed without a resolved DUNS.

---

## Stage 2 - Retrieve Report Data

**Purpose:** Pull the full D&B company report to populate the Credit Decisioning Report
template. Use portfolio data to supplement where available.

**Tool call sequence:**

1. Call `get_company_report` with the resolved DUNS.
   - Set `continue_report_pull` to `false` unless the user explicitly answered "yes" to
     a previous prompt about report retrieval. Do NOT carry this parameter over from
     earlier tool calls - each request requires a fresh evaluation.
   - Extract all fields listed in the Data Extraction Guide below.
2. Call `query_portfolio` with the resolved DUNS to retrieve any current portfolio
   account data (outstanding, past due, credit limit utilisation, account type).
   - Portfolio data supplements the report but does not override it for risk scores.
   - If the company is not in the portfolio, note this in the report.

For any field not available in the tool output: use `Not available via tools`.
For news and funding events: `get_company_report` does not provide these natively - mark as
`Not available via tools` unless a separate tool call is made.

**Failure condition:** If `get_company_report` fails after one retry, document the gap and
produce a constrained report using any portfolio data available from `query_portfolio`.
Clearly label the report as constrained due to data unavailability.

---

## Stage 3 - Produce Credit Decisioning Report

**Purpose:** Populate and output the Credit Decisioning Report template using all data
retrieved in Stage 2. The template structure must be respected exactly.

**Formatting rules:**

- Use ATX headings only (`#`, `##`, `###`). No bolded pseudo-headings.
- Put a blank line after each heading and before/after every list or table.
- Do not start a list on the same line as a colon; move lists to the next line.
- Keep lists single level unless hierarchy requires nesting.
- Output `$` as `\$` to avoid encoding issues.

Exclude all articles that are neutral, irrelevant, or positive unless they contain embedded
credit-negative implications.

**Output format - Summary:**

Output the label `Summary:` exactly.

- If one or more negatively relevant items are found: provide exactly one concise sentence
  summarising key credit-negative themes. Group related topics into meaningful categories
  (e.g., liquidity pressure, governance instability, regulatory risk). Do not include article
  numbers or references in the summary.
- If no negatively relevant items are found: output exactly `Summary: No negatively impacting
  news found.` Do not generate the article list in this case.

**Output format - Relevant Articles** (only if negatively relevant items exist):

Output the label `Relevant Articles:` exactly. Number items sequentially starting from 1
(restart numbering in this section). For each article: provide a short title or one-sentence
overview, one sentence on the credit-relevant negative implication, and the article link.

### Detailed Financials

Present the same financial fields as in Company Profile. By default, present the latest
available financial snapshot. If historical data is available from `get_company_report`,
present it as a table with one metric per row and each available year as a column. Note
that more historical data may be available on explicit request.

## Known Tool Integration Notes

| Tool | Issue | Handling |

| `query_portfolio` | A company may have multiple accounts per DUNS | Retrieve all accounts; summarise outstanding and past due at DUNS level |
| `fa_search_tool` | May return multiple candidates | Present a selection table; do not auto-select when ambiguous |

---

## Behavioural Requirements (Credit Decisioning - specific)

- Never make a binding credit approval or decline. The report is an informational credit
  assessment - final credit decisions must go through `fa-credit-validation.md` or the
  decisioning tools.
- Do not skip any template section. Use `Not available via tools` or `Not applicable` for
  missing data - never leave a section empty.
- Prefer `get_company_report` data over `query_portfolio` data for risk scores and financial
  data. Portfolio data supplements the report; it does not replace it.
- Always include the complete audit trail at the bottom of the output.
