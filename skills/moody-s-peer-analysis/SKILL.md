  Produce a Peer Analysis HTML report for a target company and its credit peers using Moody's
  GenAI MCP tools. Use this skill whenever the user asks to compare a company against its peers,
  run a peer analysis, do a credit peer comparison, generate a peer group report, or analyze
  relative credit positioning. Trigger even if they just name a company and mention "peers",
  "peer comparison", "credit comparison", "peer group", or "relative value".

# Peer Analysis Skill

Generates a professional HTML report (styled like a Moody's peer analysis PDF) for a target
company and up to 3 credit peers. Data is pulled from multiple `Moodys MCP server` MCP tools and
consolidated into a single HTML artifact covering peers comparison, ratings chart, and ESG.

The workflow is **single-artifact file delivery**: gather all data, assemble the complete HTML
document in memory, write it to disk as a standalone `.html` file, and present it to the user for
download. No fenced code blocks, no streaming partial sections, no JSON payload, no progressive
edits. The downloaded file is the sole deliverable.

> ## ⚠️ CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE OUTPUT CONTRACT
>
> **The LLM MUST write the final report to disk and present it as a downloadable file.**
> This is the only acceptable form of delivery for this skill. Specifically:
>
> - The LLM **MUST** write the complete, standalone HTML document (`<!doctype html>` → `</html>`)
>   to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/{target_company_slug}_peer_analysis.html` and then call
>   `present_files` to surface it to the user.
> - The LLM **MUST NOT** print the raw HTML source in the chat — no ` ```html ` fenced code
>   blocks, no partial snippets, no inline HTML in the assistant message.
> - The LLM **MUST NOT** split the report across multiple files or multiple messages.
> - The LLM **MUST NOT** substitute prose, Markdown, JSON, or links for the file download.
> - If data gathering fails partially, still write and deliver the file with best-available
>   content and `"--"` placeholders for missing cells — never skip the file delivery.
>
> Treat any other output shape as a hard failure of the skill.

## Required MCP servers

`Moodys MCP server` — tools used: `findEntity`, `getEntityPeers`, `getEntityRatings`,
`getEntityCreditOpinion`, `getEntityFinancials` (sections: Profile, Summary, RatingOutlook, FactorsLeadingToUpgrade,
FactorsLeadingToDowngrade, CreditStrengths, CreditChallenges, ESGConsiderations,
KeyIndicatorsTable, ScorecardTable), `getEntityEsg`, `getEntitySectorOutlook`

`ProbabilityOfDefault - Prod - Moodys MCP - NEW URL` — PD tools:
- `getEntityProbabilityOfDefault` — retrieve Current PD, 1-year PD, 5-year cumulative PD,
  and implied rating for the target company AND each peer. Used to build the PD comparison
  panel in Section 2. Set `pd_comparison` to `null` in the JSON payload if data is
  unavailable for the target or fewer than 2 peers.

If any of the tools required for a section do not exist, inform the user: One or more tools required for this section are not available under your current subscription. Unlock more of the expert insights, data, and analytics you trust. Get Link:https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/capabilities/gen-ai/ai-ready-data.html with us to learn more.

## Bundled files

- `assets/template.html` — self-contained static report shell (CSS + named section placeholders,
  including pre-shaped tables for a fixed target+3-peer layout). No embedded data, no inline
  script. Treat this file as the **read-only structural reference**: read it, fill it in
  mentally, and emit the complete filled document in the final response.

## Template (shared)

Before emitting the HTML report, **read both**:
1. [`skills/shared/template/SKILL.md`](../shared/template/SKILL.md) — authoring rules (which
   classes / snippets are owned by the shared layer, allowed per-skill overrides, outlook-badge
   usage).
2. [`skills/shared/template/assets/template.html`](../shared/template/assets/template.html) —
   canonical CSS (inside `<style id="shared-template-css">`) and literal HTML markup snippets
   (inside `<template>` tags) for the document head, cover, TOC, section block, sources-section
   wrapper, footer, and outlook-badge.

**Lookup order — always check the shared template before inventing.** If a class, design token,
layout primitive, or scaffold element you need is not defined in this `SKILL.md` or already
present in this skill's `assets/template.html`, the shared template skill is authoritative. Do
not invent CSS, HTML scaffolds, or design tokens that the shared skill already provides; do not
silently restyle anything the shared skill owns (cover, TOC, section, sources-section wrapper,
footer, outlook-badge, design tokens, reset, body / page base).

At emit time, copy the **contents** (not the `<style>` wrapper) of `<style id="shared-template-css">`
from the shared asset into the parent template's reserved marker region between the CSS-comment
markers `/* BEGIN shared-template-css ... */` and `/* END shared-template-css */`. For HTML
scaffolds (head boilerplate, cover, TOC, sources-section wrapper, footer), use the literal markup
from the matching `<template>` snippet in the shared asset. The parent template no longer
carries duplicated chrome CSS — those rules ship only in the shared asset.

This skill uses the **`cover-multi`** variant. Skill-specific override retained above the
marker region: `**.page { max-width: 1050px }**` (PA reports are wider than the 900px canonical
default to fit the multi-column scorecard / key-indicators tables). Skill-specific CSS that
stays local: `.sub-heading`, all PA-specific table classes (`.pa-table`, `.credit-drivers-table`,
`.ki-table`, `.sc-table`), and the chart helpers (`.chart-container`, `.chart-title`,
`.chart-legend`, `.chart-legend-item`, `.chart-legend-swatch`). All outlook-badge usage in this
skill must use the canonical pastel variants (`stable` / `positive` / `negative` / `review` /
`na`) defined by the shared skill — no solid-fill or inline-color overrides. PA flags the target
entity on the cover with `class="company-chip target"`; the chip wrappers themselves come from
the shared cover-multi snippet.

## Citations (shared)

Before emitting any `[n]` reference inline, any per-section recap block, or the end-of-document
Citations block, **read both**:
1. [`skills/shared/citations/SKILL.md`](../shared/citations/SKILL.md) — authoring rules
   (numbering, hyperlinking, source data shape, carve-outs).
2. [`skills/shared/citations/assets/template.html`](../shared/citations/assets/template.html) —
   canonical CSS (inside `<style id="shared-citations-css">`) and literal HTML markup snippets
   (inside `<template>` tags) for inline references, the end-of-document Citations block, and
   the optional `.section-citations` recap.

At emit time, copy the **contents** (not the wrapper) of `<style id="shared-citations-css">`
from the shared asset into the parent template's reserved marker region, located inside
`assets/template.html` between the CSS-comment markers
`/* BEGIN shared-citations-css … */` and `/* END shared-citations-css */`. The parent
template no longer carries duplicated citation CSS — those rules ship only in the shared
asset.

The prefix used for the end-of-document container in this skill is `pa`, so the container id
is `#pa-sources`. Optional per-section recap blocks live in `#pa-cite-peers`,
`#pa-cite-ratings`, and `#pa-cite-esg`. Internal MCP tool names (e.g. `getEntityCreditOpinion`)
are NEVER rendered inside `.source-meta`.

---

## Step 1 — Resolve the target company

Call `findEntity` with the company name provided by the user. Store the canonical entity name
and entity ID.

If the user provides only one company name, that is the **target company**. The peers will be
discovered automatically in Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — Discover and resolve peers

Call `getEntityPeers` for the target company. Select the top 3 peers returned.

You now have a set of up to **4 companies** (1 target + up to 3 peers). For each peer, call
`findEntity` to resolve its canonical entity name and ID.

---

## Step 3 — Read the template

Read `assets/template.html` (relative to this skill directory) once. Keep its exact structure —
CSS, `<head>`, section order, table skeletons (including all pre-shaped 4-company columns/rows),
row labels, and element IDs — as the scaffold for the final artifact. Do **not** copy it to the
workspace and do **not** open it.

---

## Step 4 — Gather all data in parallel

For every company in the set (target + up to 3 peers), fire **all of the following in a single
parallel batch** (one message, many tool calls):

### Credit Opinion data (per company)

Call `getEntityCreditOpinion`,`getEntityFinancials` requesting these sections, about the key Indicators table this should be populated with most recent fiscal year available (e.g. 2025 FY) on `getEntityFinancials`. Not LTM allowed:

> **CRITICAL — `getEntityFinancials` is the authoritative source for all quantitative data.**
> Always call `getEntityFinancials` (with `excludeInterimData: true`) for every entity in the
> peer set to obtain the most recent **fiscal year-end** figures. Do NOT rely solely on the
> Key Indicators or Scorecard exhibits embedded in `getEntityCreditOpinion` — those may
> reference an older period. After fetching financials, identify each entity's latest year
> with a non-null Revenue value and use that year exclusively for Key Indicators charts,
> Scorecard "Current" column, and the Revenue bar chart. LTM figures are **not permitted**.

| Section parameter | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Profile` | Company description for the Peers Table |
| `FactorsLeadingToUpgrade` | Upgrade factors for Credit Drivers |
| `FactorsLeadingToDowngrade` | Downgrade factors for Credit Drivers |
| `CreditStrengths` | Credit strengths for Credit Drivers |
| `CreditChallenges` | Credit challenges for Credit Drivers |
| `KeyIndicatorsTable` | Financial metrics for Key Indicators table |
| `ScorecardTable` | Scorecard data |

### Ratings (per company)

Call `getEntityRatings` — retrieve the current long-term rating, rating class, rating date,
outlook, and historical ratings (need at least the last 5 rating actions for the Ratings Chart).

### ESG (per company)

Call `getEntityEsg` — overall CIS classification plus E, S, G sub-scores.

### Sector outlook (once per sector)

Call `getEntitySectorOutlook` for the target company's sector. Reuse for peers in the same
sector.

### Probability of Default (target + all peers)

Call `getEntityProbabilityOfDefault` for the target company AND every resolved peer in a
single parallel batch. Retrieve:
- 1-year PD (%)
- 5-year cumulative PD (%)
- PD-implied rating

Compute the **peer average** for 1-year PD and 5-year cumulative PD (exclude the target).
Determine `pd_signal`:
- `"red"` — target 1-year PD is >2× peer average
- `"amber"` — target 1-year PD is 1.25–2× peer average
- `"green"` — target 1-year PD is ≤1.25× peer average

Build `pd_gap_1yr` label (e.g. `"+0.079pp above peer avg (3.5×)"`).

Set `pd_comparison` to `null` if the PD tool is unavailable or data is missing for the target
or fewer than 2 peers — the panel is suppressed automatically.

Hold all results in context for Step 5 synthesis.

---

## Step 5 — Synthesize + emit the complete artifact

After data is gathered, assemble the complete filled HTML document and write it to disk, then
present it to the user for download (see Step 7 for the file-naming and delivery contract).

The assembled document **must**:

- Be a complete, standalone HTML document (doctype → `</html>`) that renders without
  external dependencies.
- Preserve the template's `<head>` (CSS, fonts), section order, table skeletons, row labels, and
  element IDs exactly. Only the empty targets defined below are populated.

Write in professional financial/credit analysis language. Always reference specific companies by
name. The target company is **always the first column / first row** in every table. Render order
of content inside the code block follows the page top-to-bottom so the artifact is human-readable
as well as browser-renderable: cover/header fields first, then Peers Comparison sub-sections
(1–6), Ratings Chart, ESG, and citations/sources last.

Attribute substantive claims with numbered citation references. The exact inline markup, the
URL-less fallback, and the rule that `n` matches the row position of the source inside
`#pa-sources` are defined in [skills/shared/citations/SKILL.md](../shared/citations/SKILL.md).

### Cover / header fields (write first)

- `#pa-report-date` — e.g. `April 20, 2026` (plain text)
- `#pa-footer-date` — same value (plain text)
- `#pa-target-company` — canonical name of the target (plain text)
- `#pa-peer-count` — integer count of peers resolved in Step 2 (plain text)
- `#pa-company-chips` — `<span class="company-chip target">Target</span>` followed by one
  `<span class="company-chip">Peer</span>` per peer (space-separated; target first)
- `#pa-cover-img-right`, `#pa-cover-img-bottom` — optional. If you have image URLs or data URIs
  to use, set the `src` attributes **and** add the `has-cover-image` class to the corresponding
  container (`<div class="cover-top has-cover-image">` and/or `<div class="cover-bottom has-cover-image">`).
  If you do not have images, leave the template as-is — the empty image strips will collapse
  automatically and the cover will render as a clean navy block with the accent bar.

### Section 1 — Peers Comparison Table & Analysis

**1) Peers Table** → `<tbody id="pa-peers-table">`

Write one `<tr>` per company. Two columns: company name + a substantive description paragraph
sourced from the Credit Opinion `Profile` section (headquarters, business overview, key
brands/segments, approximate TTM revenue). Description paragraphs may carry inline citations.

**2) Peers Rating** → `<tbody id="pa-peers-rating">`

Write one `<tr>` per company. Three columns: company name, rating (formatted as
`{rating} ({rating class} / {date})`), and `<span class="outlook-badge …">Outlook</span>`.
Use class rules below.

**3) Credit Drivers** — 5 rows × 4 company columns, pre-shaped `<table>` with per-cell IDs

Write the 4 company header cells first:
- `#pa-cd-col-1` — target name (plain text)
- `#pa-cd-col-2`, `#pa-cd-col-3`, `#pa-cd-col-4` — peer names in order (leave empty if fewer
  than 3 peers were resolved)

Then write the 16 body cells (`#pa-cd-r{1..4}-c{1..4}`). Each cell is a substantive paragraph
with specific quantitative thresholds where available. Cells may carry inline citations:

- Row 1 (`Upgrade factors`) — from `FactorsLeadingToUpgrade`
- Row 2 (`Downgrade factors`) — from `FactorsLeadingToDowngrade`
- Row 3 (`Credit strengths (qualitative)`) — from `CreditStrengths`
- Row 4 (`Credit challenges (qualitative)`) — from `CreditChallenges`

> **Row 5 ("Quantitative support") has been removed.** Do NOT emit a 5th row in the Credit
> Drivers table. The pre-shaped table in `assets/template.html` has 5 row slots — leave
> `#pa-cd-r5-c{1..4}` blank and suppress the row label for Row 5 by setting its `<th>` to
> an empty string or by omitting it entirely if the template allows. Quantitative metrics
> are covered by the Key Indicators bar charts immediately below.

If a Credit Opinion section is missing for a company, write `Not available` in the corresponding
cell rather than leaving it blank.

**4) Key Indicators — Peer Bar Charts** → `#pa-ki-charts`

Replace the static Key Indicators table with a set of **horizontal peer bar charts** matching
the visual style from the sector-drift report. Emit a `<div id="pa-ki-charts">` block
containing **five** `peer-bar-chart-outer` panels, one per metric:

| Chart | Metric | Unit | Source | Note on "lower is better" |
|-------|--------|------|--------|--------------------------|
| 1 | FCF Margin % | `%` | (OCF − \|Capex\|) / Revenue | Higher = better |
| 2 | Debt / EBITDA | `x` | Moody's pre-computed Key Indicators | Lower = better |
| 3 | EBITDA Margin % | `%` | EBITDA / Revenue | Higher = better |
| 4 | EBITA / Interest | `x` | Moody's pre-computed Key Indicators | Higher = better |
| 5 | RCF / Net Debt | `%` | Moody's pre-computed Key Indicators | Higher = better |

For each chart:
- Show one bar per company (target first, then peers sorted by descending value, then AVERAGE last)
- The target bar uses `background:#0066cc` (blue); AVERAGE bar uses `background:#2e7d32` (green)
- Peers use `background:#7ca8d8` (steel blue) for positive values, `background:#e0a0a0` for negative
- Draw an orange median line (`background: #e87722`) at the peer median position
- **Show the fiscal year for each company's bar** by appending the FY label in parentheses to
  the `pbc-name` element (e.g. `Target Co (FY2025)`, `Peer A (FY2024)`). This is required
  because different entities may have different most-recent fiscal years. Use the same FY
  year identified via `getEntityFinancials` for each entity.
- Display the fiscal year reference at the top of the block (e.g. `FY2025, % of revenue | Orange line = peer median | Green bar = peer average`); if entities have mixed FYs, write `Most recent FY` instead of a single year
- Include a note line at the bottom with: peer median, peer avg (n=X), company value, gap

**Compute peer average and peer median** across all resolved peers (exclude the target).

**FY period header**: show the most recent common FY year at the top of `#pa-ki-charts` in
a `<div class="ki-fy-header">` (e.g. `KEY INDICATORS — FY2025 | Company vs. Peers`).

**Reference snippet** for one chart panel (emit five of these inside `#pa-ki-charts`):

```html
<div id="pa-ki-charts">
  <div class="ki-fy-header">KEY INDICATORS — FY2025 | Company vs. Peers</div>

  <div class="peer-bar-chart-outer">
    <div class="pbc-title">FCF MARGIN — COMPANY VS. PEERS</div>
    <div class="pbc-subtitle">FY2025, % of revenue | Orange line = peer median | Green bar = peer average</div>
    <div class="pbc-rows">
      <!-- Target (subject) row -->
      <div class="pbc-row">
        <div class="pbc-name subject" title="Target Co">Target Co</div>
        <div class="pbc-track">
          <div class="pbc-median-line" style="left:52.3%"><div class="pbc-median-tip">Median 8.4%</div></div>
          <div class="pbc-fill subj-neg" style="left:0;width:12.1%"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="pbc-val neg">-2.1%</div>
      </div>
      <!-- Peer rows (sorted descending by value) -->
      <div class="pbc-row">
        <div class="pbc-name" title="Peer A">Peer A</div>
        <div class="pbc-track">
          <div class="pbc-median-line" style="left:52.3%"></div>
          <div class="pbc-fill peer-pos" style="left:0;width:100%"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="pbc-val pos">12.3%</div>
      </div>
      <!-- AVERAGE bar (last, separated by dashed border) -->
      <div class="pbc-row" style="margin-top:6px;padding-top:6px;border-top:1px dashed #d0d7e3">
        <div class="pbc-name average">AVERAGE</div>
        <div class="pbc-track">
          <div class="pbc-fill avg-bar" style="left:0;width:70.7%"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="pbc-val avg-val">8.7%</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="pbc-note">Peer median 8.42% | Peer avg 8.70% (n=6, Moody's). Company: -2.10%. Gap vs. median: -10.52pp.</div>
  </div>

  <!-- Repeat for Debt/EBITDA, EBITDA Margin %, EBITA/Interest, RCF/Net Debt -->
</div>
```

**Bar width calculation** — for charts with only positive values:
- Find `maxAbs` = max of all absolute values across company + peers
- `fillW` = `(value / maxAbs * 88).toFixed(1) + '%'`

For charts that could include negative values (FCF Margin):
- Use a zero-anchored track: `zeroPct = 44`, positive bars grow right, negative bars grow left
- `fillW = (|value| / maxAbs * 44).toFixed(1) + '%'`
- `fillL` for negative: `(zeroPct - |value|/maxAbs*44).toFixed(1) + '%'`

**Median line position**: `medPct = (medV / maxAbs * 88).toFixed(1) + '%'` (positive-only charts)

Source all values from `getEntityFinancials` (most recent FY — same period used in scorecards).
If a value is missing, omit the bar row for that company.

**5) Scorecards** — 7 rows × 8 sub-columns (4 companies × Current/Forward), pre-shaped `<table>`

Write the 4 top-level company headers first:
- `#pa-sc-col-1` — target name
- `#pa-sc-col-2`, `#pa-sc-col-3`, `#pa-sc-col-4` — peer names

Write the 8 sub-header labels:
- `#pa-sc-col-{1..4}-curr` — current-period label that **must exactly match the most-recent
  FY period used for that entity in the Key Indicators bar charts** (e.g. if Apple's KI data
  is from FY2025, write `FY2025`; if Microsoft's is from FY2024, write `FY2024`). Each
  entity's label is set independently — do not force a single common year across all columns.
- `#pa-sc-col-{1..4}-fwd` — forward-period label (e.g. `Forward`)

> **FY LABEL SYNCHRONY — STRICTLY ENFORCED (Sections 4 and 5):**
> The fiscal year label shown in Section 4 (Key Indicators bar charts) for each entity
> **MUST be identical** to the label shown in the `#pa-sc-col-{n}-curr` sub-header for that
> same entity in Section 5 (Scorecards). This is a hard consistency requirement:
>
> - Determine the most-recent non-null full fiscal year-end for each entity from
>   `getEntityFinancials` (with `excludeInterimData: true`). Label it as `FY{YYYY}`
>   (e.g. `FY2025`, `FY2024`). **Never use "LTM", "TTM", "Current", or any period
>   label other than the specific `FY{YYYY}` form.**
> - Write that exact `FY{YYYY}` string in:
>   1. The `pbc-name` element of each company's row inside every Section 4 bar chart
>      (appended in parentheses, e.g. `Apple Inc. (FY2025)`), AND in the
>      `<div class="ki-fy-header">` block label.
>   2. The `#pa-sc-col-{n}-curr` sub-header cell for that entity in Section 5.
>   3. The data values themselves — all numbers in Section 4 and Section 5 Current cells
>      must be sourced from the same `FY{YYYY}` period.
> - If two entities have different most-recent FYs, each gets its own correct label
>   independently. The header `<div class="ki-fy-header">` should then read
>   `KEY INDICATORS — Most Recent FY | Company vs. Peers`.
> - This synchrony check is mandatory before emitting the final HTML. Mismatched labels
>   between Section 4 and Section 5 are a hard failure of the skill.

> **`~` (tilde) prefix rule — STRICT:** The `~` prefix (e.g. `~2.5x`, `~15%`) means
> *approximately estimated / forecast* and must **only** appear in **Forward** (`-fwd`) cells.
> It must **never** appear in **Current** (`-curr`) cells. Current-period cells contain actual
> reported or Moody's-adjusted figures sourced from `getEntityFinancials`; use the precise
> value as-is (e.g. `2.3x`, `14.8%`). If the exact current figure is unavailable, write `N/A`
> — do not substitute a tilde-prefixed estimate.

Then write the 56 body cells (`#pa-sc-r{1..7}-c{1..4}-curr` and `-fwd`) for the 7 rows:
- Row 1 — Scale: Revenue/Sales (USD bn)
- Row 2 — Profitability: EBIT(A) margin
- Row 3 — Leverage: Debt/EBITDA
- Row 4 — Cash flow: RCF/Net debt
- Row 5 — Coverage: EBIT(A)/Interest
- Row 6 — Scorecard-indicated outcome
- Row 7 — Actual rating

Source from `ScorecardTable` in the Credit Opinion and `getEntityFinancials`

**6) Conclusion** → `#pa-conclusion`

Three `<p>` paragraphs focused on **differentiation** of the target among its peers. Paragraphs
may carry inline citations:

- Paragraph 1: How the target differentiates positively vs. weaker peers on quantitative metrics
  (leverage, coverage, cash flow). Cite specific ratios.
- Paragraph 2: Business risk profile comparison — where the target is more concentrated or less
  diversified vs. stable peers. Reference upgrade/downgrade triggers.
- Paragraph 3: Practical positioning — frame the target's "path to stand out" by linking back
  to the upgrade/downgrade framework and key risk factors.

### Section 2 — Ratings Chart (± Probability of Default)

> **SECTION 2 TITLE RULE — STRICTLY ENFORCED:**
> The heading for Section 2 (in both the TOC `<li>` and the `<div class="section-heading">`)
> must be set **conditionally** at emit time:
>
> - If PD data is available (i.e. `pd_comparison` is NOT `null`) →
>   use **"Section 2. Ratings Chart & Probability of Default"**
> - If PD data is unavailable (i.e. `pd_comparison` is `null`, the MCP server is unreachable,
>   or data is missing for the target or fewer than 2 peers) →
>   use **"Section 2. Ratings Chart"**
>
> The template ships with the longer title as a placeholder; overwrite it in both locations
> (`#sec2 .section-heading` and the matching `<li>` in `<ul class="toc-list">`) whenever
> PD data is absent. Never show "& Probability of Default" in the title if there is no PD panel.

**Chart** → `#pa-ratings-chart`

Emit a single inline `<svg>` block authored by the agent (see SVG template below). The chart
plots the last 5 rating actions for each company as a line chart. X-axis uses sequential labels
(`Rating 1` … `Rating 5`, most recent first); Y-axis maps Moody's rating symbols to a numeric
scale.

**PD Panel** → `#pa-pd-panel`

Immediately after the ratings chart, emit the Probability of Default panel as a **horizontal
bar chart** using the same `.peer-bar-chart-outer` style as the Key Indicators charts in
Section 1. If PD data is unavailable, leave `#pa-pd-panel` empty (the element collapses).

Emit one `peer-bar-chart-outer` block showing the **1-year PD (%)** for each company. Use the
same CSS classes and bar-width formula as the KI charts (`pbc-fill`, `pbc-track`, `pbc-rows`,
etc.). Include a note row at the bottom with peer median, peer average, and the gap signal.

Signal colouring for the target bar:
- `pbc-fill subj-neg` (red) — target 1-year PD > 2× peer average (`pd_signal: "red"`)
- `pbc-fill subj-pos` (blue) — all other cases

**Reference snippet** (emit this block directly into `#pa-pd-panel`):

```html
<div class="peer-bar-chart-outer">
  <div class="pbc-title">PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT — 1-YEAR PD (%)</div>
  <div class="pbc-subtitle">Moody's PD model | Orange line = peer median | Green bar = peer average</div>
  <div class="pbc-rows">
    <!-- Target (subject) row — blue or red depending on pd_signal -->
    <div class="pbc-row">
      <div class="pbc-name subject" title="Target Co">Target Co</div>
      <div class="pbc-track">
        <div class="pbc-median-line" style="left:38.5%"><div class="pbc-median-tip">Median 0.032%</div></div>
        <div class="pbc-fill subj-neg" style="left:0;width:100%"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="pbc-val neg">0.111%</div>
    </div>
    <!-- Peer rows (sorted descending by pd_1yr) -->
    <div class="pbc-row">
      <div class="pbc-name" title="Peer A">Peer A</div>

**Bar width calculation:** `fillW = (pd_1yr / maxPD * 88).toFixed(1) + '%'` where `maxPD` is
the maximum 1-year PD across all companies including the target.

**Median line position:** `medPct = (medianPD / maxPD * 88).toFixed(1) + '%'`

**Analysis** → `#pa-ratings-analysis`

One `<p>` paragraph on rating trajectories — which companies show improvement, deterioration,
or stability, and what that implies for relative credit positioning. May carry inline citations.

### Section 3 — ESG Table & Analysis

**ESG Table** → `<tbody id="pa-esg-table">`

Write one `<tr>` per company. Five columns: company name, Overall (CIS-*), Environmental (E-*),
Social (S-*), Governance (G-*).

**Analysis** → `#pa-esg-analysis`

Two `<p>` paragraphs. Paragraphs may carry inline citations:

- Paragraph 1: Compare ESG profiles across the peer set. Identify which companies share similar
  profiles and what drives the overall classification.
- Paragraph 2: Highlight the key differentiator (typically Governance) and explain which company
  stands out as weaker/stronger and why.

### Citations & sources (write last)

- `#pa-cite-peers` — optional `<div class="section-citations">…</div>` recap for the
  peers-comparison section. Use the markup defined in
  [skills/shared/citations/SKILL.md](../shared/citations/SKILL.md). Omit if empty.
- `#pa-cite-ratings` — optional recap for the ratings-chart section. Same markup.
- `#pa-cite-esg` — optional recap for the ESG section. Same markup.
- `#pa-sources` — end-of-document Citations rows. One `<div class="source-item">` per source,
  in `[1], [2], …` order, using the canonical row markup from the shared citations skill.
  Internal MCP tool names are NEVER rendered in `.source-meta`.

## Ratings Chart SVG template

Emit the entire chart as a single HTML string into `#pa-ratings-chart`. The agent authors the
SVG directly — there is no runtime script.

### Hardcoded constants

- Dimensions: `W = 700`, `H = 350`
- Padding: `PAD_L = 70`, `PAD_R = 30`, `PAD_T = 30`, `PAD_B = 50`
- Plot area: width `= W - PAD_L - PAD_R = 600`, height `= H - PAD_T - PAD_B = 270`
- Number of x-axis points: `maxPts` = the largest number of ratings any company has, capped at 5
- Palette (first = target): `#0066cc`, `#e6550d`, `#1a7a4a`, `#8b5cf6`, `#d63384`

### Moody's rating → numeric value map

| Rating | Value | Rating | Value |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Aaa | 21 | Ba1 | 11 |
| Aa1 | 20 | Ba2 | 10 |
| Aa2 | 19 | Ba3 | 9 |
| Aa3 | 18 | B1 | 8 |
| A1 | 17 | B2 | 7 |
| A2 | 16 | B3 | 6 |
| A3 | 15 | Caa1 | 5 |
| Baa1 | 14 | Caa2 | 4 |
| Baa2 | 13 | Caa3 | 3 |
| Baa3 | 12 | Ca | 2 |
|     |    | C | 1 |

`RATING_LABELS` (index 0..20 → symbol): `["C", "Ca", "Caa3", "Caa2", "Caa1", "B3", "B2", "B1", "Ba3", "Ba2", "Ba1", "Baa3", "Baa2", "Baa1", "A3", "A2", "A1", "Aa3", "Aa2", "Aa1", "Aaa"]`.

### Coordinate formulae

Compute once per chart:

- Collect every rating value across all companies' last-5 series → `values[]`.
- `minV = clamp(min(values) - 1, 1, 21)`
- `maxV = clamp(max(values) + 1, 1, 21)` (ensure `maxV > minV`; if equal, set `maxV = minV + 1`)

Per point `(i, v)` where `i` is the x-index (0-based) and `v` is the rating value:

- `xPos(i) = PAD_L + (i / (maxPts - 1)) * 600` = `70 + (i / (maxPts - 1)) * 600`
- `yPos(v) = PAD_T + 270 - ((v - minV) / (maxV - minV)) * 270` = `30 + 270 - ((v - minV) / (maxV - minV)) * 270`

### Class-selection rules

**`.outlook-badge`** modifier (inside peers-rating rows):

- `stable` — outlook is "Stable"
- `positive` — outlook is "Positive"
- `negative` — outlook is "Negative"
- `review` — outlook contains "Review" (e.g., "Rating Under Review")
- `na` — outlook is missing or unknown

**`.company-chip.target`** applies only to the target (first) chip. Remaining chips use plain
`.company-chip`.

### Conventions

- Use `<p>` for paragraphs, `<ul><li>` for bullets, `<strong class="subsection-title">…</strong>`
  for bold subheaders inside prose containers.
- Emit inline citations per [skills/shared/citations/SKILL.md](../shared/citations/SKILL.md).
  Inline citations are the primary attribution mechanism — the optional per-section blocks
  (`#pa-cite-peers`, `#pa-cite-ratings`, `#pa-cite-esg`) remain available as supplementary
  summary boxes.
- Do NOT include overall section titles — the template already has those.
- `rating` values: use Moody's rating symbol (e.g. `Aaa`, `Aa1`, `Baa2`, `Ba1`). If not found,
  use `N/A`.
- `outlook` values: `Stable`, `Positive`, `Negative`, `Rating Under Review`, or `N/A`.

## Tips

- Run ALL data-gathering tool calls in a single parallel batch (one message, many tool calls).
- Write the final HTML to disk as a single `.html` file and deliver it via `present_files` — do not print the HTML source in the chat, do not split across multiple files.
- The target company always appears as the first column / first row in every table and
  comparison.
- The conclusion must orient around the target company — how it differentiates from its peers.
- If fewer than 3 peers are returned, leave the unused column/row IDs empty. The pre-shaped
  tables keep those cells blank — do not attempt to collapse or restructure the table.
- If `getEntityCreditOpinion` does not return a particular section, write `Not available` in the
  corresponding cell rather than leaving it blank.
- `getEntitySectorOutlook` typically applies to all companies in the same sector — call once
  and reuse.
- Emit the ratings-chart SVG directly into `#pa-ratings-chart` — the template no longer builds
  the chart at render time. Pick the `.outlook-badge` class yourself using the rules above.
- For companies with fewer than 5 historical ratings, either repeat the oldest available rating
  value to fill the trailing points, or reduce `maxPts` in the chart formula to the largest
  available count (and drop the corresponding `Rating k` x-axis labels).
- Inline citations follow the shared citations skill — read
  [skills/shared/citations/SKILL.md](../shared/citations/SKILL.md) before authoring any `[n]`
  reference or the Citations block.
- **PD panel**: write the fully rendered HTML directly into `#pa-pd-panel` using the CSS classes
  already in the template (`.pd-panel`, `.pd-stats`, `.pbc-rows`, etc.). The template's `<script>`
  block handles the `data-pd` attribute approach as a fallback, but writing innerHTML directly is
  preferred in the static-artifact delivery mode. If PD data is unavailable, leave `#pa-pd-panel`
  empty (the section collapses automatically).
- **Key Indicators bar charts**: write the complete `#pa-ki-charts` block directly — five
  `.peer-bar-chart-outer` panels. Use the CSS classes `.pbc-rows`, `.pbc-row`, `.pbc-name`,
  `.pbc-track`, `.pbc-fill`, `.pbc-val`, `.pbc-median-line`, `.pbc-median-tip` already defined
  in the template. The FY period header goes in `<div class="ki-fy-header">` as the first child
  of `#pa-ki-charts`.

---

## Step 7 — Save and deliver the report as a downloadable file

After assembling the complete HTML string (same content that would have been emitted as the
fenced code block), **write it to disk as a standalone `.html` file** and make it available for
the user to download. Do **not** print the raw HTML in the chat.

### File naming

Use the pattern: `{target_company_slug}_peer_analysis.html`

Where `{target_company_slug}` is the target company's canonical name lowercased, spaces and
special characters replaced with underscores (e.g. `apple_inc_peer_analysis.html`).


### Delivery

After writing the file, use whatever file-presentation capability is available in the current
environment to surface the file to the user so they can open or download it. Do not describe
the tool being used — just invoke it. Then add one short confirmation sentence, for example:
`The peer analysis report for [Target Company] is ready to download above.`

Do **not** print the HTML source in the chat. Do **not** emit a fenced ` ```html ` code block.
The saved file is the sole deliverable.

## Amendment: Always use the most recent fiscal year for Key Indicators and Scorecards

When populating the Key Indicators table (`#pa-ki-r{1..4}-*`) and the Scorecard table
(`#pa-sc-r{1..7}-c{1..4}-curr`), always use the **most recent fiscal year-end (FY) data
available** from `getEntityFinancials` — never default to an earlier year simply because
the credit opinion's Key Indicators table cites it, or because one peer's most recent year
differs from another's.

### Procedure

1. After calling `getEntityFinancials` with `excludeInterimData: true`, inspect the
   returned columns for each entity and identify the **latest year with a non-null Revenue
   value** — that is the most recent fiscal year end for that entity.
2. Use that year's figures for the Key Indicators table and the "Current" column of the
   Scorecard, regardless of what year the credit opinion's exhibit uses.
3. If different entities have different most-recent years (e.g. one entity has 2025 data
   while another only has 2024), use each entity's own most recent year independently and
   label the `#pa-ki-r{n}-v1` cell accordingly (e.g. `2025 FY` vs `2024 FY`). The
   `#pa-sc-col-{n}-curr` sub-header for that entity's Scorecard column **must show the same
   FY label** used in the Key Indicators for that entity — this is the consistency requirement.
   Never use a generic label like `Current` alone; always include the specific year
   (e.g. `FY2025`, `FY2024`).

### Handling distorted EBITDA years

If the most recent fiscal year contains a non-cash charge (e.g. goodwill impairment) that
makes reported EBITDA or Debt/EBITDA not meaningful on a reported basis:
- Still use that year as the period reference.
- Populate EBITDA and ratio cells with the reported figure plus a `†` marker (e.g.
  `-$1.6B†`, `N/M†`).
- Add a footnote below the Key Indicators table explaining the distortion and citing the
  Moody's-adjusted figure where available from the credit opinion.
- Use the Moody's-adjusted ratio (from the credit opinion's Key Indicators table) for the
  Scorecard leverage cell rather than the distorted reported figure.

## Amendment: Visual Enhancements

Three additional visual components are added to the report. Emit them inline as part of the
single HTML artifact (same non-negotiable output contract applies). All new elements use only
the CSS classes already defined in `assets/template.html` — no external scripts or libraries.

---

### Visual 1 — Rating Summary Cards (`#pa-rating-cards`)

Placed **immediately after** the Peers Rating table (sub-heading 2), before sub-heading 3
(Credit Drivers). Emit one `.rating-card` per company (target first, then peers in order).
The target card carries the extra class `target-card`.

**What to populate:**
- `.rc-company` — abbreviated company name (≤ 25 chars; truncate with "…" if longer)
- `.rc-rating` — Moody's rating symbol (e.g. `Baa2`)
- `.rc-class` — rating class + date (e.g. `Senior Unsecured / 2024-05-09`)
- `.outlook-badge` — outlook badge using the canonical pastel classes (`stable`, `positive`,
  `negative`, `review`, `na`)

**Reference snippet** (emit one block like this per company inside `#pa-rating-cards`):

```html
<div class="rating-card target-card">
  <div class="rc-company">Target Co</div>
  <div class="rc-rating">Baa2</div>
  <div class="rc-class">Senior Unsecured / 2024-05-09</div>
  <span class="outlook-badge stable">Stable</span>
</div>
```

---

### Visual 2 — Revenue Comparison Bar Chart (`#pa-fi-charts`)

Placed **immediately after** `#pa-ki-charts`, with **no separate sub-heading** between them.
Both `#pa-ki-charts` and `#pa-fi-charts` appear under the same section 4 heading (`4) Key Indicators — Peer Bar Charts`). Do **not** emit a `<div class="sub-heading">` before `#pa-fi-charts`. Emit a **single** `peer-bar-chart-outer` panel for **Revenue** only, using
exactly the same CSS classes and bar-width formula as the Key Indicators charts.

> **Note:** Debt/EBITDA is already covered in the Key Indicators charts — do NOT add a
> second Debt/EBITDA chart here. Revenue is the only metric shown in `#pa-fi-charts`.

**Source:** `getEntityFinancials` (same most-recent FY used in Key Indicators).
**Format:** `$XB` (e.g. `$180.2B`); if missing write `N/A` and omit the bar.

**Bar width calculation:** `fillW = (revenue / maxRevenue * 88).toFixed(1) + '%'` where
`maxRevenue` is the maximum revenue across all companies **including** the target and the peer
average bar.

**AVERAGE bar — REQUIRED:** Compute the **peer average revenue** (arithmetic mean of all
resolved peers, excluding the target). Add an AVERAGE bar as the last row, separated by a
dashed top border, using class `pbc-fill avg-bar` (green) and `pbc-name average`. The AVERAGE
bar width uses the same formula: `(peerAvgRevenue / maxRevenue * 88).toFixed(1) + '%'`. If
`peerAvgRevenue` exceeds `maxRevenue`, recalculate `maxRevenue` to include it.

No median line needed for Revenue.
Target bar uses `pbc-fill subj-pos` (blue). Peer bars use `pbc-fill peer-pos`. Average bar
uses `pbc-fill avg-bar` (green), label class `pbc-name average`, value class `pbc-val avg-val`.

**Reference snippet:**

```html
<div id="pa-fi-charts">
  <div class="peer-bar-chart-outer">
    <div class="pbc-title">REVENUE — COMPANY VS. PEERS</div>
    <div class="pbc-subtitle">FY2025, USD billions</div>
    <div class="pbc-rows">
      <div class="pbc-row">
        <div class="pbc-name subject" title="Target Co">Target Co</div>
        <div class="pbc-track">
          <div class="pbc-fill subj-pos" style="left:0;width:88%"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="pbc-val pos">$180.2B</div>
      </div>
      <div class="pbc-row">
        <div class="pbc-name" title="Peer One">Peer One</div>
        <div class="pbc-track">
          <div class="pbc-fill peer-pos" style="left:0;width:29.7%"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="pbc-val pos">$61.0B</div>
      </div>
      <!-- Repeat for all resolved peers -->
      <!-- AVERAGE bar — always last, separated by dashed border -->
      <div class="pbc-row" style="margin-top:6px;padding-top:6px;border-top:1px dashed #d0d7e3">
        <div class="pbc-name average">AVERAGE</div>
        <div class="pbc-track">
          <div class="pbc-fill avg-bar" style="left:0;width:XX.X%"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="pbc-val avg-val">$XX.XB</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="pbc-note">Revenue sourced from Moody's financials (most recent FY). Peer avg (n=3): $XX.XB.</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Omit bar rows for companies that were not resolved (fewer than 3 peers). Always include the
AVERAGE bar as long as at least one peer is resolved.

---

### Visual 3 — ESG Score Heatmap (`#pa-esg-heatmap`)

Placed **immediately after** the ESG table, before `#pa-esg-analysis`. Emit a colour-coded
HTML table (inside `div.esg-heatmap`) that makes the CIS and sub-scores scannable at a glance.

**Colour mapping** — apply a CSS class to each score `<td>` based on numeric severity
(lower CIS/sub-score = better):

| Score | Class | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `esg-s1` | Green — minimal risk |
| 2 | `esg-s2` | Light green — limited risk |
| 3 | `esg-s3` | Amber — moderate risk |
| 4 | `esg-s4` | Orange — high risk |
| 5 | `esg-s5` | Red — very high risk |

Parse the numeric suffix from the Moody's score string (e.g. `CIS-3` → 3, `E-4` → 4).
If the score is `N/A` or missing, omit the colour class (plain white cell).

**Reference snippet:**

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Company</th>
      <th>CIS (Overall)</th>
      <th>E Score</th>
      <th>S Score</th>
      <th>G Score</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Target Co</td>
      <td class="esg-s3">CIS-3</td>
      <td class="esg-s4">E-4</td>
      <td class="esg-s3">S-3</td>
      <td class="esg-s2">G-2</td>
    </tr>
    <!-- one <tr> per company, same order as all other tables -->
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### Updated element ID mapping (addendum)

| Element ID / selector          | Content                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `#pa-rating-cards`            | `.rating-card` divs — one per company (target first)                   |
| `#pa-ki-charts`               | Five `.peer-bar-chart-outer` bar chart panels (Key Indicators as bar charts) |
| `#pa-fi-charts`               | Single `.peer-bar-chart-outer` panel (Revenue only)                    |
| `#pa-esg-heatmap`             | `.esg-heatmap` table with colour-coded CIS / E / S / G scores          |
| `#pa-pd-panel`                | PD comparison panel — rendered client-side from `pd_comparison` JSON   |

## Amendment: Section Layout, Ratings Chart, and ESG Display Overrides

### Section 1 — Revised sub-section order

Emit sub-sections in this exact order:

1. **Peers Table** (`<tbody id="pa-peers-table">`) — unchanged, as defined above.
2. **Rating Cards only** (`#pa-rating-cards`) — emit the `.rating-card` blocks as defined in
   Visual 1. **Do NOT emit the `<tbody id="pa-peers-rating">` table at all.** The cards are the
   sole representation of peer ratings in Section 1.
3. **Credit Drivers table** — unchanged, as defined above.
4. **Key Indicators Bar Charts** (`#pa-ki-charts`) — five horizontal bar chart panels (FCF
   Margin, Debt/EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, EBITA/Interest, RCF/Net Debt). **Do NOT emit the
   `<table id="pa-key-indicators">` at all.** The bar charts are the sole representation of
   key indicator data. Immediately after `#pa-ki-charts` (with **no separate sub-heading**),
   emit the **Revenue Bar Chart** (`#pa-fi-charts`) — a single `peer-bar-chart-outer` panel
   showing Revenue only. `#pa-fi-charts` is visually part of section 4; it must **not** be
   preceded by its own `<div class="sub-heading">` element. **Do NOT add a Debt/EBITDA chart
   here** — it is already present in the KI charts above.
5. **Scorecard table** — unchanged, as defined above.
6. **Conclusion** (`#pa-conclusion`) — unchanged.

The `<table>` element whose `<tbody>` carries `id="pa-peers-rating"` must be **omitted entirely**
from the emitted HTML. Do not render it, do not hide it with CSS, do not leave an empty wrapper.

The `<table id="pa-key-indicators">` must also be **omitted entirely**. The bar charts in
`#pa-ki-charts` replace it completely.

---

### Section 2 — Enhanced Ratings Chart

Replace the plain SVG line chart described earlier with the enhanced version below. The output
must still be emitted inline inside `#pa-ratings-chart`.

**Design goals:** visually polished, readable at a glance, clearly differentiates companies with
colour and shape, highlights the most-recent rating prominently.

**Layout — SVG viewBox `"0 0 780 400"`:**

- Left padding (y-axis labels): 80 px
- Right padding: 30 px
- Top padding: 40 px
- Bottom padding (x-axis labels + legend): 60 px
- Plot area: 670 × 300 px (x: 80→750, y: 40→340)

**Y-axis:** draw one horizontal gridline + label per rating tier present in the data set (use the
`minV`→`maxV` range from the coordinate formulae above, but now label with the Moody's symbol,
not a number). Gridlines are `stroke="#e5e7eb"`. Labels are `font-size="11"`, `fill="#64748b"`,
`text-anchor="end"` at `x="74"`.

**X-axis:** draw the baseline (`stroke="#334155"`, `stroke-width="1.5"`). Label each point with
the **actual rating date** (formatted `MMM YYYY`, e.g. `Jan 2023`) instead of `Rating N`.
Labels `font-size="10"`, `fill="#64748b"`, `text-anchor="middle"`, `y="358"`.

**Lines:** `stroke-width="2.5"`, rounded joins (`stroke-linejoin="round"`, `stroke-linecap="round"`).

**Data points:** each rating action is a `<circle r="5">` filled with the company colour. The
**most-recent point** (rightmost) for each company is instead a `<circle r="7">` with a white
inner ring — achieved by stacking a white `<circle r="4" fill="white"/>` on top of the coloured
outer circle. Add a `<title>` element inside each point group for tooltip text:
`{company} · {rating symbol} · {date}`.

**Value labels:** above each data point, emit a `<text>` showing the Moody's rating symbol
(`font-size="9"`, `fill` = company colour, `text-anchor="middle"`, `dy="-10"`). Suppress the
label if it would overlap a neighbour (points within 40 px horizontally from the same series can
share a label only at the leftmost occurrence; skip the rest in that cluster).

**Colour palette:** same as all other charts — target `#0066cc`, peer 1 `#e6550d`,
peer 2 `#1a7a4a`, peer 3 `#8b5cf6`.

**Legend:** emit below the SVG as a `<div class="chart-legend">` row (same pattern as before),
but add the actual current rating symbol in parentheses after each company name, e.g.
`Target Co (Baa2)`.

**Reference snippet** (abbreviated — fill in real coordinates from the formulae):

```html
<div class="chart-container">
  <div class="chart-title">Rating History — Last 5 Actions</div>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 780 400" width="100%" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet">

    <!-- … -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Section 3 — ESG: Heatmap Only

**Do NOT emit the plain `<table>` whose `<tbody>` carries `id="pa-esg-table"`**. Remove it
entirely from the output HTML — do not render it, do not hide it.

Instead, emit **only** the colour-coded heatmap table (`#pa-esg-heatmap`, as defined in
Visual 3 above) as the sole ESG data table. Follow it immediately with `#pa-esg-analysis`.

The heatmap already contains all the same data (company, CIS, E, S, G scores) in a more
readable, colour-coded format; the plain table is redundant and must be omitted.

**Revised Section 3 emit order:**

1. `#pa-esg-heatmap` (colour-coded heatmap table — the only ESG table)
2. `#pa-esg-analysis` (two analysis paragraphs, unchanged)
3. Optional `#pa-cite-esg` recap block (if citations are present)

---

### Summary of omissions (do NOT emit these elements)

| Element | Reason |
|---|---|
| `<table>` wrapping `<tbody id="pa-peers-rating">` | Replaced by rating cards |
| `<table id="pa-key-indicators">` | Replaced by peer bar charts (`#pa-ki-charts`) |
| `<table>` wrapping `<tbody id="pa-esg-table">` | Replaced by ESG heatmap |
