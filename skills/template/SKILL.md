  Canonical rules and HTML/CSS contract for the page chrome (head boilerplate, cover, table of

  across Moody's Agentic Solutions HTML report skills (earnings-call-summary, peer-analysis,

  classes, allowed per-skill overrides, outlook-badge usage) AND `assets/template.html` (canonical
  CSS + literal HTML snippets) before emitting any report. The asset is the source of truth for

# Template Skill (shared)

This is the **single source of truth** for the visual chrome of every HTML report produced by
the parent skills `earnings-call-summary`, `peer-analysis`, `public-information-book`, and
`sector-analysis` and others. It owns:

- Design tokens (`--navy`, `--accent`, `--gray-*` / `--g*`, `--text`, `--positive`, `--negative`,
  `--neutral`).
- The CSS reset.
- Body and page base styling. The canonical defaults are `body { font-size: 13px }` and
  `.page { max-width: 900px }`; ECS / SA inherit them as-is, PA overrides `max-width` to
  `1050px`, and PIB overrides both (`font-size: 12.5px`, `max-width: 920px`).
- Both cover variants (`cover-simple` for PIB / SA; `cover-multi` for ECS / PA).
- TOC styling (`.toc-page`, `.toc-heading`, `.toc-list`, `.toc-num`, `.toc-label`, `.toc-dots`).
- Section styling (`.section`, `.section-heading`, `.section-content` and its descendants).
- The canonical pastel `.outlook-badge` (`stable` / `positive` / `negative` / `review` / `na`).
- Anchor base styling.
- Footer styling (`.report-footer`, `.footer-logo`).
- Print rules.
- The HTML scaffolds for the document head, both covers, the TOC block, the section block, the
  sources-section wrapper, the footer, and the outlook-badge.

The canonical CSS and the literal HTML markup contracts live in
[`assets/template.html`](./assets/template.html). This `SKILL.md` describes the rules; the asset
file ships the verbatim implementation. **Parent skills must read both files before emitting.**

## When to read this skill

Read this skill from a parent skill **before** emitting any HTML report. Parent skills must
contain a directive near the top of their `SKILL.md` instructing the agent to read **both**
this file and `assets/template.html`. The pairing is identical to the `skills/shared/citations/`
contract — every HTML report touches both shared skills.

## Lookup-order rule (non-negotiable)

Whenever the agent is about to author CSS, an HTML scaffold, a class name, a design token, or
any visual chrome that the parent skill does not itself define, it must consult this shared
template skill **first** and only fall back to inventing markup if the shared layer also does
not cover the need. Do not silently restyle anything the shared skill owns; do not invent CSS or
HTML scaffolding for elements the shared skill already provides.

## Output contract (single global rules)

1. Every emitted HTML report inlines the contents of `<style id="shared-template-css">` from
   `assets/template.html` between the `/* BEGIN shared-template-css ... */` and
   `/* END shared-template-css */` CSS-comment markers in the parent template's `<style>`
   block. Parent templates ship only the marker comments; they never duplicate the rules.
2. Every emitted HTML report uses the literal markup from the matching `<template>` snippet for
   the document head, cover (one of `cover-simple` / `cover-multi`), TOC, section block,
   sources-section wrapper, and footer. Class names and attribute order are invariant.
3. Each parent skill picks **exactly one** cover variant. Variants do not mix within a single
   report.
4. Per-skill CSS overrides (see "Per-skill overrides" below) live **above** the marker region
   in the parent template's `<style>` block — never inside it, and never as duplicated copies
   of shared rules.

## 1. Document head (snippet `document-head`)

The shared `document-head` snippet is the literal contract for the top of the parent template:
`<!DOCTYPE html>`, the `<html>` / `<head>` / `<meta>` / `<title>` boilerplate, and the
`<style>` block that contains:

1. Skill-specific overrides (see below).
2. The `/* BEGIN shared-template-css ... */` marker region.
3. The `/* BEGIN shared-citations-css ... */` marker region.

Then `<body>` opens with `<div class="page">`, which wraps the cover, TOC, report body, and
footer. Substitute `{report_title}`.

## 2. Cover (snippets `cover-simple` and `cover-multi`)

Two variants. Each parent skill uses exactly one:

| variant       | used by                                  | shape                                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `cover-simple`| `public-information-book`, `sector-analysis` | 1-column navy cover, top "logo + title" / bottom `.cover-meta`. |
| `cover-multi` | `earnings-call-summary`, `peer-analysis` | 2-region grid: `.cover-top` with navy `.cover-left` + optional `.cover-strip` image + `.cover-bar-top`; `.cover-bottom` is an optional landscape band. |

Cover-multi rules:

- Add the `has-cover-image` class to `.cover-top` and/or `.cover-bottom` **only when an `<img>`
  is populated** in `.cover-strip` / `.cover-landscape`. Without the class, the strip and bar
  are hidden by the canonical CSS.
- `.cover-companies` lists per-skill chips. PA marks the target entity with
  `class="company-chip target"`; ECS lists the issuer first.
- The `.cover-companies-label` text is per-skill (e.g. `PEERS`, `COMPANIES`).
- Cover-image content (the `<img>` URLs) is per-skill data; the wrapper classes are shared.

Cover-simple rules:

- One `.cover-meta` row at the bottom; populate as many `<span><strong>Label:</strong> value</span>`
  pairs as the parent skill needs. PIB always emits `Type: Public Information Book`.

## 3. Table of contents (snippet `toc-block`)

The TOC scaffold is identical across all four skills. Each parent fills the `<ul class="toc-list">`
with one `<li>` per section it emits, in document order, using the `.toc-num` / `.toc-label` /
`.toc-dots` pattern. The trailing TOC entry always points to the Citations block
(`#{prefix}-sources-anchor`, label `Citations`).

## 4. Section block (snippet `section-block`)

Every titled section in the report body uses the `<div class="section" id="{prefix}-section-{slug}">`
> `<div class="section-heading">` + `<div class="section-content">` shape. The body of
`.section-content` is skill-specific (paragraphs, tables, lists, charts).

The `<div id="{prefix}-cite-{slot}"></div>` placeholder inside `.section-content` is **opt-in**
and only relevant to skills that consume the per-section citation recap from
`skills/shared/citations/`. Skills that do not opt in omit the placeholder.

## 5. Sources-section wrapper (snippet `sources-section-block`)

This is the same wrapper that `skills/shared/citations/` defines as `<template id="sources-section">`,
re-shipped here so the document scaffold stays self-contained. The wrapper anchors the TOC link
target via `id="{prefix}-sources-anchor"` and contains `#{prefix}-sources` for the rows. The
**rows themselves** (`.source-item`) are owned by `skills/shared/citations/`, not by this skill.

## 6. Report footer (snippet `report-footer`)

The footer is identical across all four skills: navy `.report-footer` band with the Moody's
Agentic Solutions logo on the left and the report date on the right. Substitute `{YYYY-MM-DD}`.

## 7. Outlook badge (snippet `outlook-badge`)

The canonical visual treatment is **pastel background + colored text**. Five variants ship in
the canonical CSS:

| class    | when to use                                                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `stable` | issuer-level outlook is `STA`/`Stable`.                                    |
| `positive`| outlook is `POS`/`Positive`.                                              |
| `negative`| outlook is `NEG`/`Negative`.                                              |
| `review` | outlook is `RUR`/`On Review` (also catches "Watch" semantics).             |
| `na`     | outlook unknown / not applicable; renders muted gray.                      |

The label text is uppercased by CSS so the inner text can be mixed-case (e.g. `Stable`).

PIB previously shipped a solid-fill variant (`background: var(--positive); color: #fff`) for
its outlook badges. That carve-out is **removed** — PIB now inherits the canonical pastel
variant from this shared skill, and parent templates must not re-define `.outlook-badge` rules.

## 8. Per-skill overrides

These rules are intentionally NOT in the canonical CSS. Each parent template keeps them above
the marker region (and only those — anything else inside the canonical block is shared):

| skill                       | allowed local overrides                                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `earnings-call-summary`     | none. Cover variant: `cover-multi`.                                    |
| `peer-analysis`             | `.page { max-width: 1050px }`. Cover variant: `cover-multi`.           |
| `public-information-book`   | `body { font-size: 12.5px }`, `.page { max-width: 920px }`. Cover variant: `cover-simple`. |
| `sector-analysis`           | none. Cover variant: `cover-simple`.                                   |
| `rating-analysis`           | Skill-managed template (Python builder `scripts/build_html.py`). Does not inline shared-template-css or shared-citations-css. Chart.js loaded from CDN. Cover variant: n/a.|


Skill-specific CSS that the shared layer does not own (and which therefore stays in each
parent template indefinitely):

- All table classes (`.yoy-table`, `.ratings-table`, `.pa-table`, `.credit-drivers-table`,
  `.ki-table`, `.sc-table`, `.fin-table`, `.data-table`, `.row-label`, etc.).
- ECS `.credit-badge`, `.ratings-factors`.
- ECS / PA cover-image accent classes that are only meaningful inside `cover-multi` and that
  use skill-specific spacing (most are already shared; anything with skill-specific tweaks
  stays local).
- PA `.sub-heading`, `.chart-container`, `.chart-title`, `.chart-legend`.
- PIB chart helpers, ratings-grid helpers.
- SA sector-card / theme-card helpers.

## 9. Canonical CSS

The canonical CSS lives **only** in `assets/template.html` inside the
`<style id="shared-template-css">…</style>` block. Parent templates do **not** carry a
duplicate copy of these rules. Each parent template instead reserves a marker region inside
its own `<style>` tag bracketed by **CSS comments** (not HTML comments — the markers sit
inside `<style>`, where `<!-- … -->` would produce CSS parse errors):

```css
/* BEGIN shared-template-css (inlined at emit time from skills/shared/template/assets/template.html) */
/* END shared-template-css */
```

At emit time, the agent copies the **contents** (not the `<style>` wrapper) of
`<style id="shared-template-css">…</style>` from the shared asset and inserts them between
those two marker comments in the final emitted HTML. Treat the canonical CSS as a single
block — do not edit values per-skill. If a parent skill needs to restyle shared chrome, change
`assets/template.html` and the next emit picks it up automatically.

### CSS variable contract

The block defines the following CSS custom properties on `:root`. They are available to every
piece of skill-specific CSS that lives above the marker region:

- `--navy`, `--accent` — primary palette.
- `--gray-100`, `--gray-200`, `--gray-300`, `--gray-400`, `--gray-700` — neutral grays.
- `--g100`, `--g200`, `--g300`, `--g400`, `--g700` — short aliases for the same grays. Both
  naming schemes resolve. Skill-specific CSS may use either family interchangeably.
- `--text` — body text color.
- `--positive`, `--negative`, `--neutral` — semantic colors used by `.outlook-badge` and
  by skill-specific tables (e.g. positive / negative deltas).

## 10. Quick checklist (use before submitting a report)

- [ ] The contents of `<style id="shared-template-css">` from `assets/template.html` have been
      inlined between the `/* BEGIN shared-template-css */` / `/* END shared-template-css */`
      markers in the emitted HTML.
- [ ] The contents of `<style id="shared-citations-css">` from
      `skills/shared/citations/assets/template.html` have been inlined between the parallel
      citations markers.
- [ ] The parent template's `<style>` block contains **no duplicated copy** of any rule that
      lives in either canonical block.
- [ ] The cover uses exactly one variant (`cover-simple` or `cover-multi`) and matches the
      parent skill's declared variant.
- [ ] `.cover-multi`'s `.cover-top` / `.cover-bottom` only carries `has-cover-image` when an
      `<img>` is populated.
- [ ] All `.outlook-badge` instances use the canonical pastel variants (`stable`, `positive`,
      `negative`, `review`, `na`). No solid-fill / inline-color overrides anywhere.
- [ ] The TOC's last row points to `#{prefix}-sources-anchor` with label `Citations`.
- [ ] The emitted footer uses `.report-footer` + `.footer-logo` markup verbatim.
- [ ] Per-skill overrides above the marker region are limited to the rows in section 8.
