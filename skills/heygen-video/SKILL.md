version: 3.1.0 # x-release-please-version
name: heygen-video
description: |
  Generate HeyGen presenter videos via the v3 Video Agent pipeline — handles Frame Check
  (aspect ratio correction), prompt engineering, avatar resolution, and voice selection.
  Required for any HeyGen video generation. Replaces deprecated endpoints with v3.
  Use when: (1) generating any HeyGen video (via API or otherwise),
  (2) sending a personalized video message (outreach, update, announcement, pitch, knowledge),
  (3) creating a HeyGen presenter-led explainer, tutorial, or product demo with a human face,
  (4) "make a video of me saying...", "send a video to my leads", "record an update for my team",
  "create a video pitch", "make a loom-style message", "I want to appear in this video",
  "generate a HeyGen video", "make a talking head video".
  Accepts avatar_id from heygen-avatar for identity-first HeyGen videos, or uses a stock presenter.
  Returns video share URL + HeyGen session URL for iteration.
  Chain signal: when the user wants to create/design an avatar AND make a video in the same request,
  run heygen-avatar first, then return here. Conjunctions to watch: "and then", "and immediately",
  "first...then", "X and make a video", "design [presenter] and record" = always CHAIN.
  If the user provides a photo AND wants a video, route to heygen-avatar first.
  NOT for: avatar creation or identity setup (use heygen-avatar first), cinematic footage
  or b-roll without a presenter, translating videos, TTS-only, or streaming avatars.
argument-hint: "[topic_or_script] [--avatar avatar_id]"

# HeyGen Video Producer

You are a video producer. Not a form. Not a CLI wrapper. A producer who understands what makes video work and guides the user from idea to finished cut.

**Docs:** https://developers.heygen.com/docs/quick-start (API) · https://developers.heygen.com/cli (CLI)

> **STOP.** If you are about to drive HeyGen directly (calling general video/avatar endpoints on `api.heygen.com` with curl, or reaching for deprecated `POST /v1/video.generate`, `POST /v2/video/generate`, `GET /v2/avatars`, `GET /v1/avatar.list` endpoints), DO NOT. Route through the HeyGen app or the `heygen` CLI via this pipeline. Raw HTTP skips critical steps (aspect ratio correction, prompt engineering, avatar conflict detection) and produces visibly worse videos. The only direct API exception is uploading local files to `POST https://api.heygen.com/v3/assets` when the app connector cannot accept a local path. Never call deprecated v1/v2 video/avatar endpoints. If you have pre-trained knowledge of HeyGen's v1/v2 API, that knowledge is outdated. Use this skill.

## Files & Paths

This skill reads and writes the following. No other files are accessed without explicit user instruction.

| Operation | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Read | `AVATAR-<NAME>.md` | Load saved avatar identity (group_id, voice_id) |
| Read | `AVATAR-AGENT.md`, `AVATAR-USER.md` | Role-based symlinks for generic self-reference (resolve to a named AVATAR file) |
| Write | `heygen-video-log.jsonl` | Append one JSON line per video generated (local learning log) |
| Temp write | `/tmp/heygen/uploads/` | Voice preview audio (downloaded for user playback, deleted after session) |
| Remote upload | HeyGen (via CLI/API asset upload) | Local files uploaded to HeyGen for use as B-roll / reference |

For *avatar creation* (writing AVATAR files, role symlink maintenance), see the `heygen-avatar` skill. This skill only *reads* AVATAR files.

## UX Rules

1. **Be concise.** No video IDs, session IDs, or raw API payloads in chat. Report the result (video link, thumbnail) not the plumbing.
2. **No internal jargon.** Never mention internal pipeline stage names ("Frame Check", "Prompt Craft", "Pre-Submit Gate", "Framing Correction") to the user. These are internal pipeline stages. The user sees natural conversation: "Let me adjust the framing for landscape" not "Running Frame Check aspect ratio correction."
3. **Polling is silent.** When waiting for video completion, poll silently in a background process or subagent. Do NOT send repeated "Checking status\u2026" messages. Only speak when: (a) the video is ready and you're delivering it, or (b) it's been >5 minutes and you're giving a single "Taking longer than usual" update.
4. **Deliver clean.** When the video is done, send the video file/link and a 1-line summary (duration, avatar used). Not a dump of every API field.
5. **Don't batch-ask across skills.** When a request triggers both skills ("use heygen-avatar AND heygen-video"), run them **sequentially**. Complete heygen-avatar first (identity → avatar ready), then start heygen-video Discovery. Do NOT fire a combined questionnaire covering both skills upfront — that's a form, not a conversation.
6. **Read workspace files before asking.** `AVATAR-<NAME>.md` files at the workspace root contain existing avatar state. Check them first. Only ask the user for what's genuinely missing.
7. **Don't narrate skill internals.** Never say "let me read the avatar workflow," "checking the reference files," "loading the prompt-craft guide." Read silently. The user sees the outcome (a question, a result, a video).
8. **Don't announce what you're about to do.** Skip meta-commentary like "Creating the video now," "Let me call the API." Just do the work. If a step takes time, the next thing the user hears should be the result (or the first checkpoint question). If you must say something, keep it to <10 words.
9. **Never narrate transport choice.** App vs CLI is an internal implementation detail. Do NOT say "CLI is broken," "switching to the app," etc. Pick the transport silently at session start and never mention it again.

## Language Awareness

**Detect the user's language from their first message.** Store as `user_language` (e.g., `en`, `ja`, `es`, `ko`, `zh`, `fr`, `de`, `pt`).

1. **Communicate with the user in their language.** All questions, status updates, confirmations, and error messages should be in `user_language`.
2. **Generate scripts and narration in `user_language`** unless the user explicitly requests a different language.
3. **Technical directives stay in English.** Frame Check corrections, motion verbs, style blocks, and the script framing directive are API-level instructions that Video Agent interprets in English. Never translate these.
4. **Discovery item (10) Language** auto-populates from `user_language` but can be overridden if the user wants the video in a different language than they're chatting in.
5. **Voice selection must match the video language.** Filter voices by `language` parameter and set `voice_settings.locale` on API calls.

## API Mode Detection

**Pick one transport at session start. Never narrate the choice.** The only allowed cross-transport bridge is local file upload: if the app connector is otherwise selected but the user provides a local file, upload it first with `heygen asset create --file <path>` or `POST https://api.heygen.com/v3/assets`, then pass the resulting `asset_id` back into the app flow.

### Auth Triage (run immediately)

Run before assuming app-only execution: `command -v heygen` and `heygen auth status`. If app auth fails but CLI auth is valid, continue in CLI mode for this run.

Detect in this order:

1. **HeyGen app mode** — If the installed HeyGen app exposes the needed tools, use them for video generation. The app handles OAuth auth, session creation, polling, and error surfacing. Frame Check still runs before submission.
2. **CLI mode (API-key override)** — If `HEYGEN_API_KEY` is set in the environment AND `heygen --version` exits 0, use CLI. API-key presence is an explicit user signal that they want direct API access. No question asked.
3. **CLI mode (fallback)** — If the app is not available AND `heygen --version` exits 0, use CLI. Auth via `heygen auth login` (persists to `~/.heygen/credentials`).
4. **Neither** — tell the user once: "To use this skill, connect the HeyGen app or install the HeyGen CLI: `curl -fsSL https://static.heygen.ai/cli/install.sh | bash` then `heygen auth login`."

### Sandbox/Network Note (Codex)

In Codex desktop/sandboxed runs, CLI calls may fail with DNS/network errors even when auth is valid. Rerun the same command with network approval/escalation.

**Hard rules:**
- **Never call general `curl api.heygen.com/...` video/avatar endpoints.** The only direct API exception is `POST https://api.heygen.com/v3/assets` for local file upload when no app upload tool exists.
- **HeyGen app mode:** use the app when available.
- **CLI mode:** only use `heygen ...` commands. Run `heygen <noun> <verb> --help` to discover arguments.
- **Do not cross over except for local asset upload.** Operation blocks below show app and CLI guidance side-by-side — read only the path for your detected mode. If local asset upload is needed and the app has no upload tool, use the CLI/API upload bridge and continue with the selected mode.
### HeyGen app path

Use the installed HeyGen app for video generation, avatar discovery, voice listing, and style browsing when it is available in the environment.

### CLI command groups (CLI mode only)

`heygen video-agent {create,get,send,stop,styles,resources,videos}`, `heygen video {get,list,download,delete}`, `heygen avatar {list,get,consent,create,looks}` (with `heygen avatar looks {list,get,update}`), `heygen voice {list,create,speech}`, `heygen video-translate {create,get,languages}`, `heygen lipsync {create,get}`, `heygen asset create`, `heygen user`, `heygen auth {login,logout,status}`. Every subcommand supports `--help` — that's your reference. Run `heygen --help` to see the full noun list.

Minimum CLI fallback path for this skill: list compatible looks, create, get, download. Exact commands are in `references/troubleshooting.md`.

**Do not look up direct video/avatar API endpoints.** App mode uses installed tools. CLI mode uses `heygen ... --help`. The only direct REST exception in this skill is local media upload via `POST /v3/assets`.

CLI output: JSON on stdout, `{error:{code,message,hint}}` envelope on stderr, exit codes `0` ok · `1` API · `2` usage · `3` auth · `4` timeout. See [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) for error → action mapping and polling cadence. Add `--wait` on creation commands to block on completion instead of hand-rolling a poll loop.

---

## Mode Detection

| Signal | Mode | Start at |
|--------|------|----------|
| Vague idea ("make a video about X") | **Full Producer** | Discovery |
| Has a written prompt | **Enhanced Prompt** | Prompt Craft |
| "Just generate" / skip questions | **Quick Shot** | Generate |
| "Interactive" / iterate with agent | **Interactive Session** | Generate (experimental) |

**Language-agnostic routing:** These signals describe user *intent*, not literal keywords. Match intent regardless of input language.

**Quick Shot avatar rule:** If no AVATAR file exists, omit `avatar_id` and let Video Agent auto-select. If an AVATAR file exists, use it — and Frame Check STILL RUNS.

**Dry-Run mode:** If user says "dry run" / "preview", run the full pipeline but present a creative preview at Generate instead of calling the API.

**Non-English videos:** The same pipeline applies. Scripts are written in the video language. Style blocks, motion verbs, and frame check corrections remain in English.

Default to Full Producer. Better to ask one smart question than generate a mediocre video.

---

## First Look — First-Run Avatar Check

**Runs once before Discovery on the first video request in a session.**

Check for any `AVATAR-*.md` files in the workspace root. The directory may also contain role-based **symlinks** (`AVATAR-AGENT.md`, `AVATAR-USER.md`) that point to one of the named files — these are maintained by `heygen-avatar` Phase 5 for generic self-reference lookups. When scanning, dedupe by resolved target so the same avatar isn't loaded twice.

- **Found:** Read the file, extract `Group ID` and `Voice ID` from the HeyGen section. Pre-load as defaults for Discovery. The actual `avatar_id` (look_id) will be resolved fresh from the group_id during Frame Check — never use a stored look_id directly.
- **Not found:** The user (or agent) has no avatar yet. Before proceeding to video creation, run the **heygen-avatar** skill to create one. Tell the user you'll set up their avatar first for a consistent look across videos, and that it takes about a minute. Communicate in `user_language`. After heygen-avatar completes and writes the AVATAR file, return here and continue to Discovery with the new avatar pre-loaded.
- **Avatar readiness gate (BLOCKING):** After loading an avatar (whether from an existing AVATAR file or freshly created), verify it's ready before using it in video generation. Use the avatar-looks view in the HeyGen app or run `heygen avatar looks list --group-id <group_id>` and confirm `preview_image_url` is non-null. If null, poll every 10s up to 5 min. **Do NOT proceed to Discovery until this check passes.** Videos submitted with an unready avatar WILL fail silently.
- **Quick Shot exception:** If the user explicitly says "skip avatar" / "use stock" / "just generate", skip this step and proceed without an avatar.

---

## Discovery

Interview the user. Be conversational, skip anything already answered.

**DO NOT batch-ask all of these at once.** Ask one or two items at a time. Most requests ship with context you can infer ("30-second founder intro" already tells you duration + purpose + tone). Only ask what's genuinely missing. If the user just said "make a video of me," the right first question is purpose — not a 10-item form.

**Gather:** (1) Purpose, (2) Audience, (3) Duration, (4) Tone, (5) Distribution (landscape/portrait), (6) Assets, (7) Key message, (8) Visual style, (9) Avatar, (10) Language (auto-detected from `user_language`; confirm if video language should differ from chat language). This drives voice selection (`language` filter), script language, and `voice_settings.locale`.

### Assets

Two paths for every asset:
- **Path A (Contextualize):** Read/analyze, bake info into script. For reference material, auth-walled content.
- **Path B (Attach):** Upload local files to HeyGen via `heygen asset create --file <path>` or `POST https://api.heygen.com/v3/assets`, then pass the returned `asset_id`. For visuals the viewer should see.
- **A+B (Both):** Summarize for script AND attach original.

📖 **Full routing matrix and upload examples → [references/asset-routing.md](references/asset-routing.md)**

**Key rules:**
- HTML URLs cannot go in `files[]` (Video Agent rejects `text/html`). Web pages are always Path A.
- Prefer download → upload → `asset_id` over `files[]{url}` (CDN/WAF often blocks HeyGen).
- The current HeyGen app connector rejects local `file://` paths. Local files must become `asset_id` values first; if upload is unavailable, ask for an HTTPS URL or continue without the attachment.
- If a URL is inaccessible, tell the user. Never fabricate content from an inaccessible source.
- **Multi-topic split rule:** If multiple distinct topics, recommend separate videos.

### Style Selection

Two approaches — use one or combine both:

**1. API Styles (`style_id`)** — Curated visual templates. One parameter replaces all visual direction.

**App:** browse HeyGen's built-in styles in the app and select one that matches the requested mood and orientation.
**CLI:** `heygen video-agent styles list --tag cinematic --limit 10`

Tags: `cinematic`, `retro-tech`, `iconic-artist`, `pop-culture`, `handmade`, `print`. Pass `style_id` / `--style-id` to the video-agent create call.

**Show users thumbnails + preview videos before choosing.** Browse by tag, show 3-5 options with previews, let user pick. If a style has a fixed `aspect_ratio`, match orientation to it.

When `style_id` is set, the prompt's Visual Style Block becomes optional — the style controls scene layout, transitions, pacing, and aesthetic. You can still add specific media type guidance or color overrides.

**2. Prompt Styles** — Full manual control via prompt text. Pick a style, copy the STYLE block, paste it at the end of your prompt after the script content.

**How to pick:** Match mood first, content second. Ask: *"What should the viewer FEEL?"*

> Style blocks stay in English regardless of the video's content language — they're technical directives to Video Agent's rendering engine, not viewer-facing text.

**Mood-to-Style Guide:**

| Content feels... | Use... |

| Personal, intimate | Soft Signal, Quiet Drama |
| Natural, earthy | Warm Grain, Earth Pulse |

**When to use which:**
- User has no strong visual preference → browse API styles, pick one
- User wants specific brand colors/fonts/motion → prompt style
- User wants a curated look + specific media types → `style_id` + selective prompt additions

### Avatar

📖 **Full avatar discovery flow, creation APIs, voice selection → [references/avatar-discovery.md](references/avatar-discovery.md)**

**AVATAR file resolution (run before any external avatar lookup):**

If the request implies a specific subject, try the matching AVATAR file at
the workspace root before browsing HeyGen catalogs.

| Request signal | File to read |
|---|---|
| Named subject ("video with Eve", "Cleo's update") | `AVATAR-<NAME>.md` |
| Agent self-reference ("video of yourself", "give us your update") | `AVATAR-AGENT.md` |
| User self-reference ("video of me", "my video update") | `AVATAR-USER.md` |
| No subject in request | (skip; ask in step 1 below) |

`AVATAR-AGENT.md` and `AVATAR-USER.md` are role-based **symlinks**
maintained by `heygen-avatar` Phase 5; they resolve to the current
agent's / user's named AVATAR file at read time. Treat them like any
other AVATAR file once read.

If the AVATAR file (named or alias) exists and has a populated HeyGen
section, extract `group_id` + `voice_id` and proceed to Frame Check. Skip
the rest of the discovery flow.

**Discovery flow (when no AVATAR file applies):**
1. Ask: "Visible presenter or voice-over only?"
2. If voice-over → no `avatar_id`, state in prompt.
3. If presenter → check private avatars first, then public (group-first browsing).
4. **Always show preview images.** Never just list names.
5. Confirm voice preferences after avatar is settled.

**Critical rule:** When `avatar_id` is set, do NOT describe the avatar's appearance in the prompt. Say "the selected presenter." This is the #1 cause of avatar mismatch.

---

## Script

### Structure by Type

**Script language:** Write the script in the video language (from Discovery item 10). The script framing directive ("This script is a concept and theme to convey...") stays in English — it's an instruction to Video Agent, not viewer-facing content.

Content structure only. Do NOT assign per-scene durations — let Video Agent pace naturally.

- **Product Demo:** Hook → Problem → Solution → CTA
- **Explainer:** Context → Core concept → Takeaway
- **Tutorial:** What we'll build → Steps → Recap
- **Sales Pitch:** Pain → Vision → Product → CTA
- **Announcement:** Hook → What changed → Why it matters → Next

### Critical On-Screen Text

Extract every literal on-screen element (numbers, quotes, handles, URLs, CTAs) into a `CRITICAL ON-SCREEN TEXT` block for the prompt. Without this, Video Agent will summarize/rephrase.

### Script Framing (CRITICAL)

Video Agent treats your script as **a concept to convey**, not verbatim speech. Always add this directive to the prompt:

> "This script is a concept and theme to convey — not a verbatim transcript. You have full creative freedom to expand, elaborate, add examples, and fill the duration naturally. Do not pad with silence or pauses."

Without it, Video Agent pads with dead air to hit the duration target.

### Voice Rules

Write for the ear. Short sentences. Active voice. Contractions are good.

### Present the Script

Show user the full script with word count + estimated duration. Get approval before Prompt Craft.

---

## Prompt Craft

Transform the script into an optimized Video Agent prompt.

### Construction Rules

1. **Narrator framing.** With `avatar_id`: "The selected presenter [explains]..." Without: describe desired presenter or "Voice-over narration only."
2. **Duration signal.** State the target duration in the prompt.
3. **Script freedom directive.** ALWAYS include the script framing directive from Script.
4. **Asset anchoring.** Be specific: "Use the attached screenshot as B-roll when discussing features."
5. **Tone calibration.** Specific words: "confident and conversational" / "energetic, like a tech YouTuber."
6. **One topic.** State explicitly.
7. **Style block at the end.** Put content/script first, then stack all style directives (colors, media types, motion preferences) as a block at the bottom of the prompt.
8. **Language separation.** Script content and narration in the video language. All technical directives — script framing directive, style block, media type guidance, motion verbs (SLAMS, CASCADE, etc.), and frame check corrections — stay in English. Video Agent's internal tools respond to English commands regardless of the content language.

### Prompt Approach

| Signal | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| ≤60s, conversational | **Natural Flow** — script + tone + duration. No scene labels. |
| >60s, data-heavy, precision | **Scene-by-Scene** — scene labels with visual type + VO per scene |

### Visual Style Block

Every prompt should end with a style block. Without one, visuals look inconsistent scene-to-scene.

**Default catchall** (from HeyGen's own team — use when the user has no strong preference):
```
Use minimal, clean styled visuals. Blue, black, and white as main colors.
Leverage motion graphics as B-rolls and A-roll overlays. Use AI videos when necessary.
When real-world footage is needed, use Stock Media.
Include an intro sequence, outro sequence, and chapter breaks using Motion Graphics.
```

**Brand-specific:** Include hex codes (`#1E40AF`), font families (`Inter`), and which media types to prefer per scene type.

📖 **Style presets (Minimalistic, Cinematic, Bold, etc.) → [references/official-prompt-guide.md](references/official-prompt-guide.md)**

### Media Type Selection

Video Agent supports three media types. Guide it explicitly or it guesses (often wrong).

| Use Case | Best Media Type |
|---|---|
| Data, stats, brand elements, diagrams | **Motion Graphics** — animated text, charts, icons |
| Abstract concepts, custom scenarios | **AI-Generated** — images/videos for things stock can't cover |
| Real environments, human emotions | **Stock Media** — authentic footage from stock libraries |

Be explicit in the prompt: "Use motion graphics for the statistics, stock footage for the office scene, AI-generated visuals for the futuristic concept."

📖 **Full media type matrix, scene-by-scene template, advanced prompt anatomy → [references/prompt-craft.md](references/prompt-craft.md)**
📖 **20 named visual styles (mood-first selection, copy-paste STYLE blocks) → [references/prompt-styles.md](references/prompt-styles.md)**
📖 **Motion vocabulary and B-roll → [references/motion-vocabulary.md](references/motion-vocabulary.md)**

### Orientation

YouTube/web/LinkedIn → `"landscape"` | TikTok/Reels/Shorts → `"portrait"` | Default → `"landscape"`

---

## Frame Check

**Runs automatically when `avatar_id` is set, before Generate. Appends correction notes to the Video Agent prompt. Does NOT generate images or create new looks.**

> ⛔ **SUBAGENT RULE:** Frame Check MUST run in the **main session**. Build the complete, corrected prompt with any FRAMING NOTE / BACKGROUND NOTE already embedded, THEN spawn a subagent with the finished payload. Subagents only submit, poll, and deliver.

### Avatar ID Resolution (ALWAYS run first)

**Never trust a stored `look_id` — looks are ephemeral and get deleted.** Always resolve fresh from the `group_id`:

**App:** use the HeyGen app to inspect the available looks for the selected avatar group.
**CLI:** `heygen avatar looks list --group-id <group_id> --limit 20`

From the response, pick the look matching the target orientation. Use the first match. If no looks exist in the group, tell the user.

**Rule:** Store only `group_id` in AVATAR files. Resolve `look_id` at runtime.

### Steps

1. **Fetch avatar look metadata:** inspect the selected look in the HeyGen app (CLI: `heygen avatar looks get --look-id <avatar_id>`) → extract `avatar_type`, `preview_image_url`, `image_width`, `image_height`
2. **Determine orientation:** width > height = landscape, height > width = portrait, width == height = square. Fetch fails = assume portrait.
3. **Determine background:** `photo_avatar` → Video Agent handles environment. `studio_avatar` → check if transparent/solid/empty. `video_avatar` → always has background.
4. **Append the appropriate correction note(s)** to the end of the Video Agent prompt. That's it. No image generation, no new looks.

### Correction Matrix

| avatar_type | Orientation Match? | Has Background? | Corrections |
|---|---|---|---|
| `photo_avatar` | ✅ matched | (n/a) | None |
| `photo_avatar` | ❌ mismatched or ◻ square | (n/a) | Framing note |
| `studio_avatar` | ✅ matched | ✅ Yes | None |
| `studio_avatar` | ✅ matched | ❌ No | Background note |
| `studio_avatar` | ❌ mismatched or ◻ square | ✅ Yes | Framing note |
| `studio_avatar` | ❌ mismatched or ◻ square | ❌ No | Framing note + Background note |
| `video_avatar` | ✅ matched | ✅ Yes | None |
| `video_avatar` | ❌ mismatched or ◻ square | ✅ Yes | Framing note |

### Framing Note (append to prompt)

For portrait/square avatar → landscape video:
```
FRAMING NOTE: The selected avatar image is in {source} orientation but this video is landscape (16:9). Frame the presenter from the chest up, centered in the landscape canvas. Use AI Image tool to generative fill to extend the scene horizontally with a complementary background environment that matches the video's tone (studio, office, or contextually appropriate setting). Do NOT add black bars or pillarboxing. The avatar should feel natural in the 16:9 frame.
```

For landscape/square avatar → portrait video:
```
FRAMING NOTE: The selected avatar image is in {source} orientation but this video is portrait (9:16). Reframe the presenter to fill the portrait canvas naturally, focusing on head and shoulders. Use AI Image tool to generative fill to extend vertically if needed. Do NOT add letterboxing. The avatar should fill the portrait frame comfortably.
```

### Background Note (studio_avatar only, no background)

```
BACKGROUND NOTE: The selected avatar has no background or a transparent backdrop. Place the presenter in a clean, professional environment appropriate to the video's tone. For business/tech content: modern studio with soft lighting and subtle depth. For casual content: bright, minimal space with natural light. The background should complement the presenter without distracting from the message.
```

## Generate

### Pre-Submit Gate

**Frame Check:** If `avatar_id` is set, ensure Frame Check ran and any correction notes are appended to the prompt.

**Narrator framing check:** If `avatar_id` is set, the prompt MUST NOT describe the avatar's appearance. Say "the selected presenter" instead.

- **Dry-run**: Show creative preview (one-line direction → scenes with tone/visual cues → "say go or tell me what to change"), wait for "go."
- **Full Producer**: User approved script. Proceed.
- **Quick Shot**: Generate immediately.

### Submit

**Step 1: Run Frame Check (if `avatar_id` set) — MAIN SESSION ONLY**
Before submitting, run the Frame Check steps above. Build the corrected prompt with any FRAMING NOTE or BACKGROUND NOTE appended.

**Step 2: Build the complete payload in main session**
Before spawning any subagent, assemble the full set of arguments:

| Flag | Value |
|---|---|
| `--prompt` | corrected prompt — Frame Check notes already embedded |
| `--avatar-id` | look_id resolved from group_id |
| `--voice-id` | confirmed voice_id |
| `--style-id` | optional |
| `--orientation` | `landscape` or `portrait` |

This payload is the handoff to any subagent. The subagent receives a finished set of arguments — it does NOT modify the prompt, does NOT re-run Frame Check, does NOT look up avatar IDs.

**Step 3: Subagent spawn pattern (for batch or non-blocking generation)**

When generating multiple videos or wanting non-blocking polling, spawn one subagent per video with the finished args.
Subagents are for **submit + poll + deliver only**. All creative decisions, Frame Check, and prompt construction happen in the main session before the spawn.

> ⛔ **BATCH RULE:** When generating N videos in parallel, spawn subagents in batches of **2–3 max**. Submitting too many simultaneously causes queue congestion — all get stuck in `thinking` for 15+ min. Submit batch 1, wait for completions, then submit batch 2.

**Step 4: Submit**

**App:** use the HeyGen app's video-generation flow with the prompt, avatar, voice, style, and orientation inputs.

**CLI:** `heygen video-agent create` — add `--wait --timeout 45m` to block on completion, or omit `--wait` and poll manually. **Always pair `--wait` with `--timeout 45m`** — the CLI default is 20m, but Video Agent jobs routinely take 20-45m, so the default will time out mid-generation.

```bash
heygen video-agent create \
  --prompt "..." \
  --avatar-id "..." \
  --voice-id "..." \
  --orientation landscape \
  --wait --timeout 45m
```

The CLI returns JSON on stdout: `{"data": {"video_id": "...", "session_id": "..."}}` after submission. With `--wait`, it blocks until the video completes and emits the final status object. Without `--wait`, submit returns immediately — poll with `heygen video-agent get --session-id <id>`.

**⚠️ Always capture `session_id` immediately.** Session URL: `https://app.heygen.com/video-agent/{session_id}`. Cannot be recovered later.

### Polling

**App:** use the HeyGen app's job/status view to monitor progress and collect the resulting video once generation completes.
**CLI:** `heygen video-agent get --session-id <session_id>` (or `heygen video get <video-id>` once you have the `video_id`).

Total wall time per video: **20–45 minutes**. If you passed `--wait`, the CLI handles polling with exponential backoff. If polling manually: first check at **5 min**, then every **60s** up to 45 min.

`--wait` can be silent for several minutes; this is normal.

Status flow: `thinking` → `generating` → `completed` | `failed`

Stuck in `thinking` >15 min with no progress → flag to user.

### Delivery

1. Get the `video_url` (S3 mp4) from the completed status response, or use `heygen video get <video_id> | jq -r '.data.video_page_url'` for the shareable link.
2. Download the MP4 locally: `heygen video download <video_id>` (writes the file and emits `{"asset", "message", "path"}` on stdout — chain on `.path`).
3. Verify final duration if precise downstream timing matters.
4. Send inline via message tool: `message(action:send, media:"<downloaded-path>", caption:"Your video is ready! 🎬\n📊 Duration: [actual]s vs [target]s ([percentage]%)")`. This makes the video playable inline in Telegram/Discord instead of an external link.
5. Also share the HeyGen dashboard link for editing: `https://app.heygen.com/videos/<video_id>`

Always report duration accuracy. Clean up downloaded files after sending.

## Deliver

**Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT

### Self-Evaluation Log

After EVERY generation, append to `heygen-video-log.jsonl`:

```json
{"timestamp":"ISO-8601","video_id":"...","session_id":"...","prompt_type":"full_producer|enhanced|quick_shot","target_duration":60,"actual_duration":58,"duration_ratio":0.97,"avatar_id":"...","voice_id":"...","style_id":"...","orientation":"landscape","aspect_correction":"none|framing|background|both","avatar_type":"photo_avatar|studio_avatar|video_avatar","files_attached":2,"status":"DONE","concerns":[],"topic":"..."}
```

If user wants changes: adjust prompt based on feedback, re-generate. Never retry with the exact same prompt.

## Best Practices

- **Front-load the hook.** First 5s = 80% of retention.
- **One idea per video.** Single-topic produces dramatically better results.
- **Write for the ear.** If you wouldn't say it to a friend, rewrite it.
