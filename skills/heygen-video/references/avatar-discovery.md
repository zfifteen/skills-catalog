# Avatar Discovery & Voice Selection (heygen-video)

This guide covers *avatar discovery for video generation* — how heygen-video
finds an appropriate presenter (or skips presenter entirely) before calling
the Video Agent. For *avatar creation*, see `heygen-avatar` and
[`../../heygen-avatar/references/avatar-creation.md`](../../heygen-avatar/references/avatar-creation.md).

## Path 0: Resolve workspace AVATAR files first

Before any HeyGen catalog lookup, check the workspace root for an
applicable `AVATAR-*.md` file. These are written by `heygen-avatar`
and contain `Group ID` + `Voice ID` ready to use, with no API call
needed.

Resolution precedence:

| Request signal | File to read |
|---|---|
| Named subject ("video with Eve", "Cleo's update") | `AVATAR-<NAME>.md` |
| Agent self-reference ("video of yourself", "give us your update") | `AVATAR-AGENT.md` (symlink) |
| User self-reference ("video of me", "my video update") | `AVATAR-USER.md` (symlink) |
| No subject in request | Skip to Path A |

`AVATAR-AGENT.md` and `AVATAR-USER.md` are role-based symlinks maintained
by `heygen-avatar` Phase 5; they resolve to the current agent's / user's
named AVATAR file at read time. Treat them like any other AVATAR file
once read.

If the resolved file has a populated HeyGen section, extract `Group ID`
and `Voice ID` and proceed to Frame Check. Skip Path A entirely. If the
file exists but the HeyGen section is empty, run `heygen-avatar` Phase 2
first.

If no file applies (no name match, no role alias, generic catalog
browsing requested) — fall through to Path A below.

## Path A: Discover Existing Avatars

### A1: Check for private avatars first

**If user specifies an avatar by name** (e.g. "use Eve's Podcast look"), take the fast path:

**App:** use the HeyGen app to browse private avatar looks and filter client-side by name match.
**CLI:**
```bash
heygen avatar looks list --ownership private --limit 50
```
Avoids the 2-call group→looks pattern.

**If user wants to browse**, use the group-first flow:

**App:**
1. Browse private avatar groups (each group = one person)
2. Open a group to view its available looks

**CLI:**
```bash
heygen avatar list --ownership private --limit 50
heygen avatar looks list --group-id <group_id> --limit 50
```

Each look has an `id` — this is the `avatar_id` you pass downstream.

Avatar types: `studio_avatar`, `video_avatar`, `photo_avatar`. Photo avatars support `motion_prompt` and `expressiveness`.

**ALWAYS show the preview image** when presenting an avatar look. Each look response includes `preview_image_url` — display inline.
Also include the look `id` and orientation (`image_width` × `image_height`) in the choice list.

### A2: Check last-used avatar

Check `heygen-video-log.jsonl` for last used avatar_id. If found:

**App:** inspect the selected look in the HeyGen app.
**CLI:** `heygen avatar looks get --look-id <look_id>`

Show preview image: "Last time you used [Avatar Name]. Use her again?"

### A3: Avatar conversation

Ask: "Do you want a visible presenter, or voice-over only?"

If voice-over only → no `avatar_id`. State in prompt: "Voice-over narration only."

If presenter wanted, present private avatars first. For public/stock avatars, browse by group:

**App:** use the HeyGen app to browse public avatar groups.
**CLI:**
```bash
heygen avatar list --ownership public --limit 20
```

Show group names + one representative image. Let the user pick a person.

**App:** use the HeyGen app to inspect looks for the selected avatar group.
**CLI:**
```bash
heygen avatar looks list --group-id <group_id> --limit 10
```

**Why group-first:** The flat `heygen avatar looks list --ownership public` call returns 50+ results for only 3 unique people per page. Group-level browsing (2 calls) gives much better discovery UX.

### A3.1: Compatibility gate (required)

Before using a public look for v3 video generation, verify compatibility:
- `supported_api_engines` must include `avatar_iv` or `avatar_v`.
- If missing/incompatible, reject that look and continue browsing.

Many public looks share duplicate names. Never identify a look by name alone. Present and confirm using:
- name
- look id
- orientation
- preview image/video URL

### A3.2: Preview quality gate (required)

Before spending credits, inspect `preview_image_url` or `preview_video_url` for composition/background quality. If the preview is visually off-topic for the request, propose another look even if technically compatible.

### A4: Voice direction

After avatar is settled, confirm voice preferences (accent, delivery style, language).

**ALWAYS show a playable voice preview.** Each voice response includes `preview_audio_url` — share it.

**Handling missing/broken previews:** Some voices may not expose a usable preview URL and can return `null`. When this happens: note "(no preview available)" and offer to generate a short TTS sample via the app's preview flow or `heygen voice speech create --text "<sample>" --voice-id <id> --input-type plain_text --language en --locale en-US` (CLI).

## Path B: Create a New Avatar

If no existing avatar fits and the user wants one created, route to the
`heygen-avatar` skill. See
[`../../heygen-avatar/references/avatar-creation.md`](../../heygen-avatar/references/avatar-creation.md)
for the full creation API surface (photo / prompt / digital twin), file
input formats, and identity field mappings.

After `heygen-avatar` finishes, an `AVATAR-<NAME>.md` file is written and
heygen-video resumes here at Path 0 to pick it up.

---

## Path C: Direct Image (Simplest for One-Off)

Skip avatar creation. Pass `image_url` directly:

**App:** use the HeyGen app's image-to-video flow when available.
**CLI:**
```bash
heygen video create -d '{
  "image_url": "https://example.com/headshot.jpg",
  "script": "<script>",
  "voice_id": "<voice_id>",
  "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
}'
```
Also accepts `image_asset_id`. Fastest path for one-off talking-head video.

---

## Voice Selection (downstream)

Voice catalog browsing for video generation:

**App:** browse available voices in the HeyGen app, filtered to the target language and voice characteristics when possible.
**CLI:**
```bash
heygen voice list --type private --limit 20

# Public voices with filters
heygen voice list --type public --engine starfish --language en --gender female --limit 20
```

For voice *design* (semantic search by description) and the full voice
selection workflow during avatar setup, see
[`../../heygen-avatar/references/avatar-creation.md`](../../heygen-avatar/references/avatar-creation.md).

---

## How Avatar/Voice Are Passed

**App:** use the HeyGen app's video-generation flow with the chosen avatar, voice, style, and orientation.

**CLI:** `heygen video-agent create` with flags:
```bash
heygen video-agent create \
  --prompt "..." \
  --avatar-id "<look_id_from_discovery>" \
  --voice-id "<voice_id_from_discovery>" \
  --style-id "<optional_style_id>" \
  --orientation landscape
```

- **Custom/stock avatar with known ID** → pass `--avatar-id`. Do NOT describe avatar's appearance in prompt. Only delivery style + background/environment.
- **No avatar_id (auto-select)** → describe desired presenter in prompt. Less reliable (~80% vs ~97%).
- **Voice-over only** → omit `--avatar-id`, state in prompt.

> Always provide explicit `--avatar-id` for presenter videos. 97.6% duration accuracy vs ~80% without.
